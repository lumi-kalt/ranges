# Range Algorithms

Toy implementations of some C++23 algorithms for ranges.
Currently requires GCC, as Clang's support for views is lacking.
May also work in MSVC.

So far, I have implemented:

- fold
  - fold_left\[_first\]
  - fold_right\[_last\]
  - product
  - sum

- view helpers
  - odd_iota
  - even_iota
